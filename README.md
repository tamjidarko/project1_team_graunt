## Background and Project Introduction
For Project 1, we decided to focus on the relationship between GDP per capita and total years of schooling. We chose to pick two very distinct countries in polar opposite geographical locations. The goal has been to see what a country culture's focus on education does to GDP, and vise versa. After conducting a significant amount of research into both policy and history, we've created a presentation that goes in-depth into how both of these countries have developed (and recessed) into the present.
